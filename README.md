# Create Google AdWords Campaign for Datacamp.com

This is an example of how you can create a full campaign using Python. I use a real life website and product real data that is good to use in a real account. 

### [Read the turorial](datacamp_sem_tutorial.ipynb)

The final output are two csv files:

1. [Keywords](keywords.csv)
2. [Ads](ads.csv)

This project uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for scraping the website and extracting data, as well as `pandas` for handling data frames. 

Enjoy!
