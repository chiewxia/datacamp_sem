    "As a heavy user of Datacamp since two years, I learned quite a lot. My main business is in online marketing, and I have benefited a lot from the data science skills I learned. I'm now able to manage way larger and more complex campaigns, and efficiently maintain them. Since I'm quite familiar now with the content and the different topics and packages in R and Python, I thought about how I might create search campaigns for Datacamp, just as an exercise. Hopefully, this serves as a real life example of how these skills are used in real projects. Here goes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The three main components of a search campaign are:     \n",
    "1. **Keywords:** the user's intention, what they are looking for.     \n",
    "2. **Ads:** your promise to the user for that intention.    \n",
    "3. **Landig pages:** your delivery of the promise.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Mapping those three elements properly is around 70-80% of the job. If you get this right, then  maintenance and changes become much easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in order to be specific and relevant to users, we need to promote the stuff that we have, and mainly focus on sending the right person to the right page, through the right message / expectation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good campaign structure reflects and follows the structure of the website, which is essentially reflecting the business strategy. "
